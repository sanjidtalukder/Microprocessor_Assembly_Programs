## 📁 Program List

### Basic Arithmetic Operations
- **add two number.asm** – Adds two numbers and stores the result  
- **add-two-number-with-message.asm** – Adds two numbers and displays the result with a message  

### Input/Output Operations
- **input-a-number.asm** – Takes numeric input from the user  
- **input-a-message-with-user.asm** – Accepts and processes user input messages  

### Logical and Conditional Operations
- **Check-Y-or-y.asm** – Checks if input is `Y` or `y`  
- **odd-even-number.asm** – Determines if a number is odd or even  
- **Largest-number-Three-variable.asm** – Finds the largest among three numbers  

### String and Character Manipulation
- **Uppercase-latter.asm** – Converts characters to uppercase  
- **Uppercase-to-lowerCase.asm** – Converts uppercase to lowercase  
- **Display-capital-A-Z.asm** – Displays capital letters A through Z  

### Loop and Counter Operations
- **display-0-9.asm** – Displays numbers 0 through 9  
- **positive-print-10.asm** – Prints positive numbers up to 10  
- **Negative-print-10.asm** – Handles and prints negative numbers  

### Stack Operations

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
To run these programs, you'll need:
- An 8086 emulator (such as **EMU8086**)  
- Or **MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler)** with **DOSBox**  
- Basic understanding of assembly language syntax  

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install an 8086 Emulator**  
   - Download and install EMU8086 or a similar emulator  
   - Alternatively, use MASM with DOSBox  

2. **Open a Program**  
   - Launch your emulator/assembler  
   - Open any `.asm` file from this repository  

3. **Assemble and Run**  
   - Click the **Assemble** button to compile the code  
   - Click **Run** to execute the program  
   - Use **Step Into** to debug and see step-by-step execution

## 📚 Learning Path

**For Beginners:**
- Start with arithmetic operations (`add two number.asm`)  
- Move to input/output programs (`input-a-number.asm`)  
- Practice with character programs (`Uppercase-latter.asm`)  
- Learn conditional logic (`odd-even-number.asm`)  

**For Intermediate Learners:**
- Study stack operations (`push-pop.asm`)  
- Explore shift operations (`RCR.asm`, `SHL.asm`)  
- Work with loops (`display-0-9.asm`)  
- Practice string manipulation programs
